# Bash Scripting Practice - HackerRank Linux Shell Challenges

This repository contains **my personal solutions** to the challenges in the **Linux Shell** domain on HackerRank.

### Important Disclaimer ⚠️
- These solutions are my own work, created during my learning and practice of Bash scripting.
- **I do not encourage or endorse cheating or direct copying of these solutions.**
- The purpose of this repository is:
  - To document my personal progress in learning Bash.
  - To build a portfolio showcasing my scripting skills.
  - To share ideas and alternative approaches as a reference for myself and others **only after** attempting the challenges independently.

**Please: Visit the challenges on HackerRank and attempt to solve them yourself first.**  
True learning comes from effort, trial, and error—not from copying solutions. Using these for cheating undermines your own growth and violates HackerRank's terms.
